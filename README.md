# 🐉 MythGenerator

**MythGenerator** is a text-generation AI project designed to create original mythological narratives based on user prompts.

The system was trained using a curated dataset of mythological creatures from multiple cultures around the world, allowing it to generate fictional myths inspired by ancient traditions, folklore structures, and symbolic motifs.

## 📌 Project Overview

The project began with the creation of an extensive list of mythological creatures from different cultures worldwide. Using ChatGPT, a total of **470 mythological entity names** were compiled.

Then:

- The **Wikipedia API** was used to extract English articles related to each creature.
- A filtering process ensured only relevant articles were included (e.g., containing terms like *"mythical"*).
- The dataset was reduced to **370 high-quality articles**.
- The content was structured and stored in JSON format for processing.
- The text was tokenized and formatted according to GPT-2 training specifications.
- Special tokens such as `USER` and `ASSISTANT` were added to help the model understand structure.
- The model was trained and fine-tuned to generate mythological text based on user prompts.

## 🖥️ Application Interface

The application provides a simple graphical interface:

- A prompt input field  
- A "Generate" button  
- A text output area where the generated myth appears  

Users can enter prompts such as:

> "In an ancient world, there was a myth of a cave wolf..."

And the model generates a fictional myth narrative based on that input.
